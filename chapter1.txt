Chapter 1: The Beginning

There was a pogi named Rammne, known throughout the small town of Luntian for his charm and wit. Rammne lived in a modest house at the edge of a lush forest, where the morning sun painted golden streaks across the dew-kissed grass. Every day, he would wake up before dawn, eager to greet the world with a smile and a sense of adventure.

On this particular morning, the air was thick with anticipation. Rammne felt it in his bones—the sense that something extraordinary was about to happen. As he stepped outside, the scent of wildflowers and the distant sound of a babbling brook filled his senses. He took a deep breath, savoring the peace, unaware that his life was about to change forever.

As he walked through the winding paths of the forest, Rammne stumbled upon a mysterious, ancient tree he had never noticed before. Its bark was etched with strange symbols, and its roots seemed to pulse with a faint, otherworldly glow. Curiosity got the better of him, and he reached out to touch the tree.

The moment his fingers brushed the bark, a surge of energy coursed through his body. Visions flashed before his eyes—distant lands, forgotten legends, and a shadow looming over Luntian. Rammne staggered back, heart pounding, as a voice echoed in his mind: "You have been chosen. The fate of your world rests in your hands."

Shaken but determined, Rammne knew he could not ignore the call. He hurried back home, gathering supplies and scribbling a quick note for his family. With a final glance at the familiar comforts of his home, he set off toward the unknown, ready to face whatever destiny had in store.

Thus began Rammne's journey—a tale of courage, friendship, and the discovery of powers he never knew he possessed. The adventure of a lifetime was about to unfold.
